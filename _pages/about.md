Jizhe Zhou (Âë®ÂêâÂñÜ), Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science, Sichuan University. He obtained his Ph.D. (early graduation) from the University of Macau in 2021. Starting from his undergraduate studies, he has pursued education and lived in three prominent locations: Macau, Hong Kong, and South Korea. In 2021, he was recruited as a specially appointed Associate Professor by Sichuan University.

Jizhe Zhou's primary research areas include the foundational architecture and theory of deep neural networks, the application of deep learning in the field of multimedia content security, and exploration in the domain of video synthesis. He has published multiple papers as the first author or sole corresponding author in top international conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-cNWmJMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> google scholar citations in the field of multimedia, such as ACM Multimedia, the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (ACL), the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) , and the International Journal of Information Forensics and Security (TIFS).

He has pioneered the field of automatic filtering of video and live content for the purpose of content security, expanding the application of deep learning in the realm of multimedia content security. He has also led the trend of using systematic deep learning frameworks for video privacy protection, information filtering, and information forensics. Jizhe Zhou has been involved in one joint project funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the Macau Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology (FDCT), as well as three research projects funded by FDCT.
